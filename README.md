# bruin-dining-plus
BruingDiningPlus is an app that displays the food options for the dining halls at UCLA. It provides users with crowd-sourced images of each dish 
and the option to rate and view the ratings of each dish. Our goal for this app is to create a fast and efficient way for UCLA students to see what is being
served at a dining hall. We built this app using the React Native framework with Node and Firebase as our backend. 

**NOTE** This app is only a prototype and is not at all 100% complete; it was created in the time span of a 12 hour Hackathon (HOTH 7)
