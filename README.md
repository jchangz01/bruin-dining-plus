# bruin-dining-plus
BruingDining+ is an app that displays the food options for the dining halls at UCLA. It provides users with crowd-sourced images of each dish 
and the option to rate and view the ratings of each dish. Our goal for this app is to create a fast and efficient way to help UCLA students decide
which dining hall to dine at. We built this app using the React Native framework with Node and Firebase as our backend. 

**NOTE** This app is only a prototype and is not at all 100% complete; it was created during a 12 hour hackathon, Hack on the Hill 7 (HOTH 7).
